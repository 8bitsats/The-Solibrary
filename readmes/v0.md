Generating UI/UX components for websites or web applications or anything using Vercel's V0.

Go to https://v0.dev/

What is v0 by Vercel?
Introduction to v0
v0 is a generative user interface system by Vercel powered by AI. It generates copy-and-paste friendly React code based on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS that people can use in their projects.

You can integrate generated UI into your React application using copy/paste, or through the CLI. The CLI will automatically install the required dependencies and add the generated code to your project.

Generating React Code with v0
Visit v0 to start creating UI with simple text prompts. The generated code will use prebuilt components and the popular Tailwind CSS library to style your UI.

You can re-prompt and edit the generated UI until you achieve your desired result. Ready to go? Then copy, paste, and ship the generated code to your Next.js application.

Integrating Generated Code into Your Next.js App

New Project

Run the following command to create a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint:

npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --tailwind --eslint

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to initialize the project for v0:

npx v0@latest init

You are now ready to add components to your project.

Existing Project

Run the following command to initialize the project for v0:

npx v0@latest init

You are now ready to add components to your project.


Adding v0 components

To integrate your generated component into your application, you can either:

Via UI
Copy Code: Click the "Code" button in the top right and copy the entire code snippet.

Integrate into Your React App: Navigate to your React project and paste the component code where required.

Via CLI

Copy CLI Command: Click the "Code" button in the top right and copy the CLI command like npx v0@latest add [id].

Run Command in Your Project: Navigate to your React project's root directory 
in your terminal and paste the copied terminal command.

How to Use the Generated Code
Once the code is generated and integrated into your React application,
you can use it like any other React component.

Components
Check out the shadcn/ui documentation for more information on the usage of the components.

Links, Images and Fonts
Please visit the documentation for Next.js Link, Next.js Image, and Next.js 
Font for more information on how to use these components.

Production Guidelines
Before moving your v0 generated code into production, keep the following in mind:

Testing for Accessibility: Ensure that your UI is accessible by testing with tools like axe and Lighthouse.
Ensuring Security: Regularly check your code for potential security issues. 
Use tools like Snyk to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

Accessibility
shadcn/ui uses Radix Primitives and pays great attention to accessibility,
adhering to the WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines and
undergoing testing across modern browsers and common assistive technologies. 
These components are designed to address the complex aspects of accessibility, 
 such as aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. 
 As such, users can trust that the components conform to the expected accessibility design patterns.

Specifically, these components adhere to WAI-ARIA semantics to provide meaning for custom UI patterns, 
ensuring they are readable by assistive tools. The library also provides abstractions for accessible 
labels and focus management,making it easier for developers to create accessible applications. 
Meanwhile, keyboard navigation is also supported in line with WAI-ARIA practices. 
To learn more about the accessibility features of Radix Primitives, please refer to their full documentation.

Even though shadcn/ui is built on accessibile primitives, you should still test your UI for accessibility. 
We recommend using tools like axe and Lighthouse to test your UI for accessibility issues. 
Automated tooling isn't enough, you should still be manually testing output. It's possible the AI generated code may need accessibility improvements.
